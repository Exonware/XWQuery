# XWUI + Astro

XWUIButton (Custom Element) in an **Astro** page (static or hydrated).

## Setup

```bash
cd examples/astro
npm install
```

Copy common assets into `public/`: `xwui-button.mjs` and `xwui/` from `examples/common/`.

## Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Astro serves `public/` at root; `<xwui-button>` works as a custom element.
