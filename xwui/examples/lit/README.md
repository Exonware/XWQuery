# XWUI + Lit

XWUIButton (Custom Element) in a **Lit** app (Vite). Lit and XWUI both use Web Components.

## Setup

```bash
cd examples/lit
npm install
```

Copy common assets into `public/`: `xwui-button.mjs` and `xwui/` from `examples/common/`.

## Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Lit treats `<xwui-button>` as a custom element; no wrapper needed.
