# XWUI + Solid

XWUIButton (Custom Element) in a **Solid** app (Vite).

## Setup

```bash
cd examples/solid
npm install
```

Copy common assets into `public/`: `xwui-button.mjs` and `xwui/` from `examples/common/`.

## Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Solid treats `<xwui-button>` as a custom element; no wrapper needed.
