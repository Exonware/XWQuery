# XWUI + Vue

XWUIButton (Custom Element) in a **Vue 3** app (Vite).

## Setup

```bash
cd examples/vue
npm install
```

Copy common assets into `public/` (from repo root): `xwui-button.mjs` and `xwui/` folder from `examples/common/`.

## Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown. Vue treats `<xwui-button>` as a custom element; no wrapper needed.
