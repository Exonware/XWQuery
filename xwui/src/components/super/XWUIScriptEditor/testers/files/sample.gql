# GQL (Graph Query Language) Example
# ISO standard for graph databases

# Create nodes
CREATE (person:Person {
  id: "p1",
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 30,
  email: "john.doe@example.com"
})

CREATE (company:Company {
  id: "c1",
  name: "Acme Corp",
  founded: 2020
})

# Create relationships
CREATE (person)-[:WORKS_FOR {
  since: "2022-01-15",
  role: "Software Engineer"
}]->(company)

# Query examples
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:WORKS_FOR]->(c:Company)
WHERE p.age > 25
RETURN p.name, c.name, r.role

# Path queries
MATCH path = (p:Person)-[*1..3]-(related)
WHERE p.id = "p1"
RETURN path

# Aggregations
MATCH (p:Person)-[:WORKS_FOR]->(c:Company)
RETURN c.name, COUNT(p) as employee_count
ORDER BY employee_count DESC
